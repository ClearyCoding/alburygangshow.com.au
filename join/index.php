                <h2>Join Albury Gang Show</h2>
                <p>Gang Show exists to provide challenging & demanding opportunities for members of the Scout and Guide Associations, to receive
                    practical training in theatre craft. Gang Show is a specialist activity that Scouting provides to allow members to develop their
                    potential further, while still being active in their own Section. Although the focus is on youth, leaders also join in with the cast to
                    support their own memberâ€™s involvement. At the completion of rehearsals Albury Gang Show performs 3 shows to a combined
                    audience of around 1,000 people.</p>
